Mahatma Gandhi,"{'input': 'Mahatma Gandhi', 'output': ""Sources:\n\n* Britannica.com\n* CulturalIndia.net\n\nMahatma Gandhi was a political and social activist who played a major role in India's struggle for independence. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, and died on January 30, 1948, in Delhi, India. Gandhi was a leader of the Indian National Congress and undertook major campaigns of nonviolent resistance against the British government. He is known for his doctrine of satyagraha, which emphasizes the use of nonviolent resistance to achieve social and political change. Gandhi's success in South Africa gave him an international reputation, and he returned to India in 1915 to lead the Indian independence movement. He grew up in a home steeped in religion and took for granted religious tolerance and the doctrine of ahimsa (noninjury to all living beings). India achieved dominion status in 1947, but the partition of the subcontinent into India and Pakistan was a great disappointment to Gandhi, who had long worked for Hindu-Muslim unity. Gandhi's legacy continues to inspire people around the world, and he is remembered for his commitment to nonviolence and his role in India's struggle for independence.""}"
